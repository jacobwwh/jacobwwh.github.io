I am an associate researcher (equal to associate professor) at Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS). Before that, I had worked at University of Alberta (2024-2025) and Nanyang Technological University (2021-2023) as a postdoctoral fellow.
I received my Ph.D degree in software engineering from Peking University, supervised by [Prof. Zhi Jin](https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/zhijin/en/index.htm). My research interests mainly focus on AI for Software Engineering, particularly using deep learning and LLMs for program understanding, code generation, and software testing.
