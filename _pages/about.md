I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at University of Alberta, working with [Prof. Lei Ma](https://www.malei.org/). Before that, I worked with [Prof. Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/) as a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University from 2021-2023. I received my Ph.D degree in software engineering from Peking University, supervised by [Prof. Zhi Jin](https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/zhijin/en/index.htm). My research interests mainly focus on AI for Software Engineering, particularly using deep learning and LLMs for program understanding, code generation, and software testing.
